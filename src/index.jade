            h3 What is it
            p Open Device Lab Copenhagen is an open lab, where web or app developers can test their sites or applications on a wide range of devices. The lab is free and open to everybody.

            h3 Why is important
            p The web is no longer just on desktop computers. The amount of web traffic from mobile devices is exploding, but the range and fragmentation of mobile devices is constantly growing. That is why we are setting up an open device lab in Copenhagen.
